suspicious of the gentleman across the street. You want to break into his house
and access his basement, but the neighbor guards his house very carefully with
traps, alarms, and general vigilance. You need to be clever and sneaky to work
around him, get the keys you need, and break into his basement...and beyond</span></p>
