and try to avoid them as you sneak into his house. If you hear a creepy noise
and see the screen go dark, it means he's discovered you or is nearby, and
you'll want to find a place to hide, such as in a closet. You can also run from
him and escape to the safety of your house — he can't get you there.</span></p>

you come across, use keys you find, or steal and use any suspicious objects you
discover. You can also use the traps, trinkets, and objects he sets up against
him, or to your own advantage. Be on the lookout for ladders and chairs he
places, and carefully observe the rooms you enter so you don't accidentally set
off one of his traps!</span></p>
