Practice in your own yard before you cross into his. You want to be accurate
for the times later in the game when you have to throw things at the neighbor,
and you'll also want to be able to throw items quickly.</span></p>

climbing them. There are some boxes in your closet that you can work with in
the early parts of the game, so get some practice in before you enter the
danger zone.</span></p>
